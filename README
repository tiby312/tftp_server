Simple TFTP server by Ken Reed

Build Instructions:
	1)set GOPATH to this directory
	2)run build.sh

Run Instructions:	
	1) Run with no arguments to pick a random port
	2) Run with first argument being the port number to listen of that port

Rudimentary Test Instructions:
	in test folder:
		
		command: sh.test_tftp.sh (portnum)
		This script using atftp client
		it will write the test picture to the server and then read it back to a different file.

Notes:
	Not fully tested. Esp. did not test packetloss. Did not write code to elegantly shutdown. Will continue to improve.
